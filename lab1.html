        <p>
            My name is Yashwanth Holur Narayanaswamy, and I am originally from Bangalore, India. Although I haven't yet gained any hands-on experience in web development, I have a strong interest in learning about the field and expanding my skill set. Currently, I am in my 3rd semester at the prestigious Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT), where I am working toward building a solid foundation in my academic journey.
